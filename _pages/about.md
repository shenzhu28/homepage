About me
-----
Iâ€™m a third year undergraduate student from [SGY](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [USTC](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I major in theoretical physics and minor in fundamental mathematics. My research interest includes geometry and quantum gravity. Besides, I have studied some phenomenological plasma physics.

Interest
-----
I am a fan of classical music, especially Russian composers from the Romantic period such as Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff and later Shostakovich and so on. As for the taste of literature, I am interested in the works of Dostoevsky, Yukio Mishima, Yasunari Kawabata and others. In addition, I have also studied modern and contemporary Chinese literature and have studied courses on the history of contemporary Chinese literature. In the field of philosophy, I learned a little bit of phenomenology and existentialism, and I think it was very helpful for my study in physics. On top of that, I have two cats.

Academic
-----
I believe physics is the most charming and appealing science or philosophy in the world, and mathematics is how we describe a phenomenon in physics, thus I would like to study both of them. The research I carried out under the guidance of Prof. Bing Wang (at [Institute of Geometry and Physics](http://igp.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm)) mainly concerned quantum gravity and modern geometric analysis.
